# Social-Distancing-Detector-Smart-CCTV-Imaging-
This project can provide Face detection and Motion detection using Haar Cascade Algorithm ,
which can provide greater security in field of burglar alarming system. Also given the current scenario of COVID-19 pandemic , 
it is at utmost necessity to maintain social distance from people to reduce the spread of COVID-19 , 
hence this project also provide Social Distance Violation Detection using YOLO coco Object Detection to measure distance between pixels in a given frame, 
which can be easily implemented in a CCTV system and place it in Domestic and Workplace Environment to monitor and ensure that proper social distancing is maintained.

#Since the file was too large hence one need to download a resource file of YOLO coco  Object detection algorithm named "yolov3.weigths" seperately and paste it in the resource folder
inside Yolo folder
